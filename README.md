# neat-tooltip
I never found a JQuery tooltip plugin that satisfies me. So I ended up making my own using Typescript and SASS.

##Demo

Look at [demo.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Monstroplante/neat-tooltip/blob/master/dist/demo.htm)

##Features:
- Light: about 3kB minified
- Very versatile
- Responsive (never get out of the screen)
- Ok on touch screens
- No image
- Create custom styles with a SASS mixin and/or custom CSS
- Tooltip content can be any html content
- Support event delegation
- Display on hover or click

## Installation

You can install with [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```bash
bower install neat-tooltip
```

## Documentation
Look at [demo.js](dist/demo.js), [demo.html](dist/demo.htm) and [demo.scss](sass/demo.scss). This is the best documentation at the moment.
