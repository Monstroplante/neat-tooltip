# neat-tooltip
I never found a JQuery tooltip plugin that satisfies me. So I ended up making my own using Typescript and SASS.

##Features:
- Light: about 3kB minified
- Very versatile
- Responsive (never get out of the screen)
- Ok on touch screens
- No image
- Create custom styles with a SASS mixin and/or custom CSS
- Tooltip content can be any html content
- Support event delegation
- Display on hover or click

## Installation

You can install by using [Bower](http://bower.io/).

```bash
bower install neat-tooltip
```

## Documentation
Look ad [demo.html](dist/demo.htm), [demo.js](dist/demo.htm) and [demo.scss](sass/demo.scss). This is the best documentation at the moment.
